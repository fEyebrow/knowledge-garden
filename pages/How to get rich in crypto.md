- 受@naval的永恒主题的启发，这里是我作为投资者和@theBlockcrunch的采访者与加密货币领域的 "成功人士 "进行的100多次对话的一些教训。
  无论你是创始人、投资者、交易员、运营商、开发者--大多数从事加密货币的人通过同样的事情致富：拥有随着时间推移而增值的资产。
  不要把拥有和交易混为一谈。虽然有些人通过交易致富，但要知道，你仍然是在出租你的时间来赚钱。
  要小心混淆叙述与牵引力。未赚取的价值累积得越快，它就会消失得越快。
  永远不要马上否定任何东西。让年轻人改变你的想法。
  如果你探索人们一贯抱怨的东西的次数足够多，你就会偶然发现一个十亿美元的机会。
  如果你在一段时间内对足够多的人有帮助，你将有机会获得创造财富的机会。你不需要成为一个编码员来增加价值：内容、网络、周到的反馈是其他一些方式。
  人们总是可以看出你从事加密货币是为了 "快速致富"。这将决定你能和哪些人一起工作，以及你在这个行业走多远。
  你走得越早，你会发现更多的上升空间，但需要更多的知识来找到正确的机会（例如，加入10B协议与token前）。
  如果你寻求稳定的薪水，就在一个稳定的行业工作。如果你承担了加密货币的法律和金融风险，就寻求因正确而获得指数级的上升回报。
  不要妨碍复利的发展。每6个月在不同的项目之间跳来跳去是不好的，会破坏你的声誉。把你的工作机会当作投资，因为它们就是投资。
  由于快钱的诱惑，加密货币是对诚信的最大考验。不要与那些未能通过测试的人合作。
- 你可能在短期内赚钱，但你将失去其他一切。
  信誉是每个创始人和投资者在招聘和交易流量方面的最高漏斗。如果你的目标是持续地创造财富，那么再多的钱也不值得。
  不要回避波动性。波动性是你为巨大的复合回报所付出的代价。
  当涉及到成本较低的机会时，"如果它成功了怎么办 "的想法胜过 "可能出错 "的想法。
  找到你的优势，加倍努力，然后扩大自己的规模。雇人/加入一个有擅长的人的团队，然后只做你擅长的事情。
  低碳货币带来了最聪明的人，但也带来了骗子和诈骗犯。有一份你将永远依赖的人的名单。有一份你永远不会与之合作的人的名单。
- 总是评估这两份名单。
  致富的一半是保持富有。在一个历史性的牛市之后，不要为了配合你的纸面财富而提升你的生活方式。
  "不要用你没有的东西去赌赢你不需要的东西" 
  不要把杠杆作用误认为是天才。你听到有人吹嘘在一年内赚到8-9位数的故事。
- 当他们在一天内输光的时候，他们往往会沉默。
  谨防邓宁-克鲁格效应。仅仅因为某人通过早期的加密货币 "成功"，并不意味着他们有能力对加密学、宏观经济、政治等发表意见。
  密码学是在叙述中运行的。叙事是由人制定的。人们总是有一个议程。
- 如果你找不到桌子上的鱼，你就是那条鱼。
  在所有行业中，加密货币的等级制度是最扁平的之一。利用这一点来加速你的财富创造。
  Crypto是压倒性的--找到你的部落，依靠其他人来扩大你的专业圈子。
  如果你慷慨地提供洞察力，其他人将以机会作为回报。如果你隐瞒见解，其他人也会这样做。
  向有经验的人学习，但只在他们的专业领域内学习。
- 忽略那些谈论技术的交易者和谈论市场的开发者。
  报答恩惠。
- Crypto充斥着不对称的机会。一个工作的介绍，一个新的团队，一个投资机会可以让你发财。回报恩惠，永远心怀感激。
  付诸行动。
- 这个领域还很年轻，你永远不知道恩惠会在哪里得到回报。当我开始工作时，那些拒绝与我通话的人现在希望得到我的建议。
  如果你擅长你的工作，人们会希望从你这里得到一些东西。不要把时间给那些有能力回报慷慨却选择不回报的人。
  人们大多得到他们应得的东西。
- 你可以抱怨风险投资公司获得分配，开发人员运送低努力的分叉，分析师没有得到足够的报酬，或者你可以做一些事情。
  最后，加密货币的剧烈波动可以在很短的时间内创造和摧毁财富。每个周期你都会听到盛产财富的故事，但也有人结束了这一切。
- 始终知道什么对你来说是重要的，什么是足够的。

- Inspired by @naval's timeless thread, here are some lessons from 100s of convos I had as an investor and as an interviewer on @theBlockcrunch speaking to people in crypto who "made it". 
  Whether you're a founder, investor, trader, operator, developer - most people in crypto get rich by the same thing: owning assets that appreciate in value over time. 
  Do not confuse owning with trading. While some get rich by trading, know that you are still renting out your time for money. 
  Be careful with confusing narratives with traction. The faster unearned value is accrued, the faster it will disappear. 
  Never dismiss anything right away. Let young people change your mind. 
  If you explore what people complain consistently about enough times you will stumble across a billion dollar opportunity. 
  If you are helpful to enough people over time, you will have access to wealth creation opportunities. You don't need to be a coder to add value: content, network, thoughtful feedback are some other ways. 
  People can always tell if you're in crypto to "get rich quick". That will determine the people you get to work with and how far you go in the industry. 
  The earlier you go, the more upside you will find, but the more knowledge will be required to find the right opportunities (e.g. joining 10B protocol vs. pre-token) 
  If you seek a stable salary, work in a stable industry. If you take on the legal and financial risk of crypto, seek to be rewarded with exponential upside for being right. 
  Don't get in the way of compounding. Hopping between projects every 6 months is bad and will destroy your reputation. Treat your job opps as investments, because they are. 
  Crypto is the greatest test for integrity due to the allure of quick money. Don't work with people who fail the test.
- You may make money in the short term, but you will lose everything else. 
  Reputation is every founder and investor's top of funnel for hiring and deal flow. No amount of money is worth that if your goal is continual wealth creation. 
  Don't avoid volatility. Volatility is the price you pay for outsized, compounded returns. 
  When it comes to opportunities with low costs, "what if it works" thinking trumps "what could go wrong" thinking. 
  Find your edge, double down, then scale yourself. Hire people/ join a team with people who are good at things you are not, then only do the things you are good at. 
  Crypto brings in the brightest, but also charlatans and scammers. Have a list of people you will always count on. Have a list of people you will never work with.
- Always evaluate those two lists. 
  Half of getting rich is staying rich. Don't upgrade your lifestyle to match your paper wealth after a historic bull market. 
  "Don't bet what you don't have to win what you don't need" 
  Do not mistake leverage for genius. You hear stories of people brag about making 8-9 figures within a year.
- They tend to be quiet when they lose it all in 1 day. 
  Beware of Dunning–Kruger effect. Just because someone "made it" by being early in crypto does not mean they are equipped to opine on cryptography, macroeconomics, politics etc. 
  Crypto runs on narratives. Narratives are crafted by people. People always have an agenda.
  If you can't find the fish at the table, you are the fish. 
  Crypto has one of the flattest hierarchies across all industries. Take advantage of this to accelerate your wealth creation. 
  Crypto is overwhelming - find your tribe and rely on other people to expand your circle of expertise. 
  If you are generous with providing insight others will reciprocate with opportunity. If you withhold insight, others will do the same. 
  Learn from experienced folks, but only within their domaine expertise.
- Ignore traders who talk about tech and developers who talk about markets. 
  Pay back favors.
- Crypto is rife with asymmetric opportunities. One intro to a job, a new team, an investment opportunity can make you rich. Reciprocate favors and always be grateful. 
  Pay it forward.
- The space is young and you never know where favors can pay off. People who refused to hop on a call with me when I started out now want my advice. 
  If you are good at what you do, people will want things from you. Don't give time to people who are in a position to reciprocate generosity but choose not to. 
  People mostly get what they deserve.
- You can whine about VCs getting allocations, developers shipping low-effort forks, analysts not getting paid enough, or you can do something about it. 
  Finally, the wild volatility in crypto can create and destroy wealth in a very short time. Every cycle you hear stories of exuberant wealth, but also people who ended it all.
- Always know what is important to you and what is enough.
