- ## Performance
- #### Under the Hood
- for example, we think that [shortening JIT compilation times](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/the-baseline-interpreter-a-faster-js-interpreter-in-firefox-70/)  and  [simplifying the optimization pipeline](- https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/11/warp-improved-js-performance-in-firefox-83/)  can substantially improve page-load and increase smooth behavior, and plan to make these kinds of changes even if it lowers our score on certain synthetic JS benchmarks like Octane and Kraken
- ### New APIs
- [Intersection Observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
- WebAssembly improves on JavaScript’s CPU efficiency with lower-level abstractions
- WebGPU improves on WebGL’s GPU efficiency with more modern graphics primitives
- WebTransport improves on WebSockets’ network efficiency with newer protocols (QUIC).
- WebAnimations
- [Prioritized Task Scheduling API ](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/)
- ### Faster Delivery
- new edge computation techniques allow developers to apply the same approach to dynamic responses using [standard Web technologies like WebAssembly](https://docs.fastly.com/products/compute-at-edge)
